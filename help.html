        <li>This app is like <a href="http://www.flopzilla.com/">Flopzilla</a>, except it's free and not as good.</li>
        <li>I had the idea when I was reading a book that talked about whether you should cbet into your opponent when you flop nothing. It mentioned that you only flop a made hand about 1/3 of the time when you have unpaired hole cards. But what about flopping a flush draw? Straight draw? Two over cards? Worse than top pair? I built this simulator to answer questions like that.</li>
        <li>I spent about a week on it, but if there's interest from others, I'll spend more time to improve it. I know the UI could be a lot better.</li>
        <li>Feel free to email me at azerner3 at gmail dot com.</li>
